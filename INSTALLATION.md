## üîê Security Considerations

### 1. Admin Panel Security
- Change admin credentials after first login
- Use strong passwords
- Limit admin panel access to trusted IPs if possible

### 2. File Permissions

- Directories: 755
- Never set permissions to 777

### 3. SSL Certificate
- Install SSL certificate for HTTPS
- Most hosting providers offer free SSL
- Force HTTPS redirection in cPanel if available

## üöÄ Performance Optimization

### 1. Enable Compression
- Most hosting providers enable Gzip automatically
- Check with your hosting provider for optimization options

### 3. Image Optimization
- Images are already optimized for web
- Consider WebP format for better compression
